# Overview

`fsmvc`

- stands for **Finite State Machine View Controller**.
- is a tool to control the rendering process of a given FSM view (basically an
Html `<canvas>` element).
- can be configured to draw network-alikes (not just FSMs).
- features import/export in several formats: JSON, LaTeX, PNG and SVG.
- is designed to be reusable in other projects but is not mobile-friendly yet.
- is MIT-released: copyright notice and convenient documentation can be found in
source code.

Note that `fsmvc` originates from Evan Wallace's [FSM Designer](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/)
created back in 2010. His project is MIT-covered too. The key difference with
`fsmvc` is that the later is customizable and ready to use in your own projects.
